CIV102 bridge MATLAB
this repo is not actively maintained.
this code is from CIV102, Fall 2021. This code was used to evaluate the failure points of a bridge made of matboard, under dynamic and static loads. 
The bridge successfully carried a dynamic load of 400N, and resisted two static loads of 1326N before plate buckling occured.
Bridge scored 5th in the class for load. Was great fun.
